# Project Name:
- Cirkle: Collaborative Learning Platform

# Project Description:
- Cirkle is a web application designed to enhance collaborative learning. 
It does this by providing an integrated platform with tools for collaboration, 
such as shared notes, file uploads, and a group pomodoro timer with 
leaderboards for your group. Many people either struggle to effectively collaborate 
or use 2-3 different platforms to meet all their needs. Cirkle aims to address this problem, 
an all-encompassing platform with only the essential features to make learning your
 next course/skill a breeze.
